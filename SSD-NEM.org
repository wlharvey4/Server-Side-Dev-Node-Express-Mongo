* About the Course
:PROPERTIES:
:unnumbered: t
:END:

This course deals with all things server-side.  We base the entire course
around the NodeJS platform.  We start with a brief overview of the Web
protocols: HTTP and HTTPS.  We examine NodeJS and NodeJS modules: Express for
building web servers.  On the database side, we review basic CRUD operations,
NoSQL databases, in particular MongoDB and Mongoose for accessing MongoDB from
NodeJS.  We examine the REST concepts and building a RESTful API.  We touch
upon authentication and security. Finally we review backend as a service (BaaS)
approaches, including mobile BaaS, both open-source and commercial BaaS
services.

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Demonstrate an understanding of server-side concepts, CRUD and REST

- Build and configure a backend server using NodeJS framework

- Build a RESTful API for the front-end to access backend services

  A Full Stack Developer is someone with familiarity in each layer, if not
  mastery in many and a genuine interest in all software technology.  Good
  developers who are familiar with the entire stack know how to make life
  easier for those around them.

*** Layers of the Full Stack
1. Server, Network, and Hosting Environment.

   - This involves understanding what can break and why, taking no resource for
     granted.

   - Appropriate use of the file system, cloud storage, network resources, and
     an understanding of data redundancy and availability is necessary.

   - How does the application scale given the hardware constraints?

   - What about multi-threading and race  conditions? Guess what, you won’t see
     those on your development machine, but they  can and do happen in the real
     world.

   - Full stack developers can work side by side with DevOps.  The system
     should provide useful error messages and logging capabilities. DevOps will
     see the messages before you will, so make them count.

2. Data Modeling

   - If the data model is flawed, the business logic and higher layers start to
     need strange (ugly) code to compensate for corner cases the data model
     doesn’t cover.

   - Full stack developers know how to create a reasonably normalized
     relational model, complete with foreign keys, indexes, views, lookup
     tables, etc.

   - Full stack developers are familiar with the concept of non-relational data
     stores and understand where they shine over relational data stores.

3. Business Logic

   - The heart of the value the application provides.

   - Solid object oriented skills are needed here.

   - Frameworks might be needed here as well.

4. API layer---Action Layer---MVC

   - How the outside world operates against the business logic and data model.

   - Frameworks at this level should be used heavily.

   - Full stack developers have the ability to write clear, consistent, simple
     to use interfaces. The heights to which some APIs are convoluted repel me.

5. User Interface

   - Full stack developers: a) understand how to create a readable layout, or
     b) acknowledge they need help from artists and graphic designers.  Either
     way, implementing a good visual design is key.

   - Can include mastery of HTML5 / CSS.

   - JavaScript is the up and coming language of the future and lots of
     exciting work is being done in the JavaScript world (node, backbone,
     knockout…)

6. User Experience

   - Full stack developers appreciate that users just want things to work.

   - A good system doesn’t give its users carpal tunnel syndrome or sore eyes.
     A full stack developer can step back and look at a process that needs 8
     clicks and 3 steps, and get it down to one click.  Full stack developers
     write useful error messages. If something breaks, be apologetic about
     it. Sometimes programmers inadvertently write error messages that can make
     people feel stupid.

7. Understanding what the customer and the business need

   - Now we are blurring into the line of architect, but that is too much of a
     hands off role.

   - Full stack developers have a grasp of what is going on in the field when
     the customer uses the software. They also have a grasp of the business.

8. Other Pieces of the Puzzle

   - Ability to write quality unit tests.  By the way, even JavaScript can have
     unit tests these days.

   - Understanding of repeatable automated processes for building the
     application, testing it, documenting it, and deploying it at scale.

   - An awareness of security concerns is important, as each layer presents its
     own possible vulnerabilities.

9. Closing Thoughts

   - It is very bad practice to tightly couple code to a specific
     implementation (library, OS, hardware, etc). Just because a full stack
     developer understands the entire spectrum doesn’t mean they have license
     to take shortcuts. Well, actually they do if it is a build and throw away
     prototype.

   - Technology start-ups need full stack developers for their versatility!
     However, as an organization matures, it needs more and more focused
     skills.

   - I’m not sure you can call yourself a full stack developer until you have
     worked in multiple languages, platforms, and even industries in your
     professional career. Full stack goes beyond a ‘senior engineer’, as it is
     along the same lines as a polyglot programmer but with a higher view of
     all the connecting pieces. Note that on my list, only items 3-5 involve
     writing code.

**** Summary of What is a Full Stack Web Developer
A full-stack web developer is someone who has honed skills in both front-end
web design/development and back-end/server coding.  You can count on a
full-stack web developer to design, code, implement and maintain a fully
functional modern interactive website on his/her own (not just a static website
with a few pages).

**** The Full Stack Web Developer
With the ever evolvement of the almighty World Wide Web, new job functions are
created virtually every day.  Just a few years ago, you only needed a web
designer to create the visual design in Photoshop and/or Dreamweaver and a web
developer to code the front-end/back-end scripts and the website was ready to
go.  At that time, websites were charged based on the number of “pages” (a
concept borrowed from print design).

Fast forward to the present, we now have (not a exhaustive list) :

- visual designer
- web designer
- UI designer
- UX designer
- interaction designer
- art director
- front-end developer
- back-end developer
- web developer
- mobile developer
- database developer
- database administrator
- web master
- web server administrator
- SEO specialist
- web analyst
- web security professional
- quality assurance tester
- project manager
- growth hacker
- …


Several roles may be taken up by the same individual depending on the size of
the company and the resources.  Very large and profitable companies may gather
experts from each field in their teams with a view to create the
best-ever-possible web products of the world.

But normally, in the down-to-earth company, the web designer/developer
distinction still applies.  The web designer will be responsible for the
visual/web/UI/UX/interaction design while the web developer will do the
front-end coding/back-end coding/database administration/server
setup/debugging/etc.  However, problems always occur in areas when the two have
to work together yet only either one takes responsible.  Factors like
miscommunications/false assumptions of job role and scope/misunderstanding of
the technology/etc.  will render the end product a subpar one.

This is where a full-stack web developer can fill the gap.  A full-stack web
developer masters the best of both worlds (or to a minimum understands both
worlds).  (S)He will be able to steer the web projects in the right direction
utilizing the best practices and latest advancements in the technology.  (S)He
will design and code the whole web project themselves or supervise others to
perform the tasks by overlooking the whole process from scratch to finish.

When websites and web applications become more and more interactive and
sophisticated, understanding the technical capabilities of the systems and
having an eye for artistic/usability judgement are critical to the success.  So
it is natural for web professionals to evolve to full-stack web developers in
due course.

However, designing and coding are two distinct skills that require different
regions of the brain to master. The right brain is for visual and creativity
and the left brain is for structure and organization.  Designers are
predominately right-brainers while coder left-brainers.  So there is still only
a handful of full-stack web developer on the market.

{{{heading(Benefits of Being a Full-Stack Web Developer)}}}

1. You can build a professional website from scratches for your employer.

2. You can be a competent member in cross-functional Agile teams where you can
   perform both front-end and back-end development.  As Agile project
   management is fast becoming the norm for web application development and
   UI/UX is gaining in importance for the success or failure of any web
   application, you will be seen as a valuable team member contributing to the
   success of projects.

3. You can start your own website design and development business.

4. You can build your own websites and monetize them through Adsense, affiliate
   marketing, selling your own products and more.  The best of this is the
   flexibility of earning extra money alongside your regular job.  There are
   many great examples of web developers turning this business into a career
   and quitting their regular jobs.

*** The Myth of the Full-stack Developer

{{{heading(“Full Stack”)}}}

My defensive tendencies are normally put on high alert when I hear that magic
phrase.  Stacks are a lot bigger than what they used to be, and being able to
claim one has acquired refined skills at every layer of web development is
certainly not a small claim.  Does this mean you have a broad range of skills
or you specialise in everything?

For a time (allegedly) Facebook only hired full-stack engineers.  This was of
course when they were building the first few versions of Facebook, which, lets
face it had a relatively simple php backend and wasn't anything special
design-wise.

{{{heading(Full-stack used to mean less layers)}}}

Coding php or Python, jQuery, HTML, CSS then transferring a few files via FTP
to your shared hosting account or dedicated server? You were full-stack.  HTML
was trivial, and even thinking of implementing any proper application code in
JavaScript wasn't possible.

My beef is not with people who can do all of the above, it's with the label
'full-stack developer'.  What does it mean in 2014?

At the level of a senior full-stack engineer we're perhaps talking about
architecting a modular Backbone/AngularJS front-end whilst optimising content
delivery and tweaking hardware accelerated layers in CSS, followed by
implementing an async non-blocking backend (which also pre-renders templates on
the server), and pushing to an AWS cluster which has been built with security
and scaleability in mind.  Not to mention design.  Designing UI responsively
and mobile-first is essential, utilising a CSS pre-processor to save time.  And
remember to setup Nagios for monitoring.  Oh, and ideally when the Continuous
Integration server detects a bad build because your end-to-end tests have
failed, get it to send you an SMS with the build error messages.  Well, the
last two are probably for bonus points.

Ask someone who labels themselves 'full-stack'.  Do they believe they have
familiarity with different layers, or true mastery?

{{{heading(Identifying mastery)}}}

I used to work with a very smart guy who when interviewing junior web
developers, used to draw a spider diagram with each of the spikes being
different layers of web development; UX, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, backend
scripting language, and SQL.  When the young developers were asked to grade
themselves out of 10 for each of the skill areas, most went for a good spread,
but a rather high spread.  It seemed nobody wanted to exceed an 8, or drop
below a 5 in any of the layers.  We can ignore the scale at which they were
grading themselves, because we were simply interpreting the grades relatively
against each other so we could get a good idea of what kind of developer the
individual saw themselves as.  I didn't hear the term 'full-stack' being used
even once, but we got a feel that everyone was an all-round web developer.
What happened next was more interesting.

On the second iteration the interviewees were given a maximum of 30 points to
distribute as they pleased.  After some frowning, some internal arguing, and
finally the self-grading we saw a lot more skewed graphs.  The 7-5 well-spread
ratings turned into more skewed 8-2's.  It seemed when faced with the harsh
reality of admitting what they were really good at, they delivered, giving
themselves 8's in their favoured areas and 2's in others.  If the candidates
really believed in their initial relative spread, we would see the same
weighting in the second round, but instead we saw front-end and back-end
developers emerge from the crowd.

Of course 99% of web developers have probably never sat through this test, and
have perhaps have never been forced to reveal what their real spread of skills
is.

{{{heading(How skilled are you in each discipline?)}}}

The basics of the languages/frameworks we learn today can often be picked up in
a matter of hours.  We no longer add skills to our CVs by taking a course, we
simply download some code and start hacking through tutorials and demo code.
The problem is, I feel the difference between knowing something in web
development and truly mastering it is now becoming an increasingly blurred
line.

It's very easy to become disillusioned with your own skills when you've
deployed some code which has been consumed by lots of users.  Let's say you've
written a web application which has scaled well under load, and you've received
great feedback.  Are you a master of everything you used in this stack?  Or are
you simply good at implementing the layers you needed to make things work
together?  Because that's an entirely different skill, and in fact a very
valuable one.

{{{heading(The skill of acquiring new skills)}}}

In my eyes the most valuable skill to have is the ability to learn, closely
followed by the ability to know when you don't know something.  I'm sure we've
all met people who decide to put brakes on their own learning because they
believe they've become a master at something.  I don't know about you, but the
smartest people I know (and the ones I have most respect for) are the ones who
are still eager to learn new things every day, from everyone they meet.  These
people just don't stop growing, in terms of both ability and character.

{{{heading(Why I'm not a full-stack developer)}}}

At one point (probably when I was about twenty-two) I heard this phrase
'full-stack' and I thought "yeah, I'm one of them".  Five years later after
working in roles with ASP, php, .Net, Node and finally JavaScript and CSS, I
only label myself as a front-end developer.  Maybe I just wasn't that good at
previous disciplines, or maybe since spending the last 2-3 years in pure
JavaScript roles I just actually realised how high the limits are when you
specialise.  This is simply opportunity I did not have when I was busy in
cross-discipline roles at smaller companies.

Sure, I've got some broad skills like a lot of developers.  However, I'd like
to think being a front-end developer now assumes some knowledge of UX, design,
and how data is modelled and served on the backend, and this is why I think the
term full-stack is old fashioned (if five years is old) and perhaps a bit smug.

Maybe, I just don't like the term.

{{{heading(Some people are willing to have a go at everything)}}}

Perhaps most respectable about all people who claim to be full-stack, is that
is conveys ambition and persistance.  The ideal developer should be willing to
have a go at learning anything, but also acknowledge when they need help from a
specialist in the team.

Perhaps I was too defensive at first, I've met too many people who pronounce
the term in a smug way, instantly causing me to discredit them.  However, say
you're full-stack in a normal way, and there will be no scrutiny from my part.
It won't be at all like meeting an investment banker or recruiter.

{{{heading(The employability of a true full-stack developer: HIGH)}}}

The chances of finding a good full-stack developer: LOW.

Smaller companies and startups NEED full-stack developers.  Developers are
often forced to acquire new skills when the resources simply aren't available.
I feel the problem for companies desperate to hire these guys and girls, is
that the real multi-skilled developers are often lost in a sea of douchebags,
claiming they know it all.

*** Multi-tier Architecture
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture


In software engineering, /multitier architecture/ (often referred to as /n-tier
architecture/) or /multilayered architecture/ is a *client–server architecture
in which presentation, application processing, and data management functions
are physically separated*.  The most widespread use of multitier architecture
is the /three-tier architecture/.

**** Introduction to What is the 3-Tier Architecture
This article is in response to [[http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2012/08/n-tier-architecture-introduction.html][N-Tier Architecture - An Introduction]] written by
Anthony Ferrara which I feel gives only a very limited view of what can be a
complex subject.  Different people have different ideas on how an application
can be split into tiers, and different ideas on the benefits which can be
gained from making such a split.  I have been designing and building
multi-tiered applications in different languages for over a decade, so my
exposure to this subject has been quite extensive.  I would like to share with
you my experiences on this subject and hopefully give you a more detailed
picture.

** Getting Started with Git
*** Setting up Git

Git Objectives and Outcomes

At the end of this lesson you should have set up Git on your computer. At the
end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Set up and use online Git repositories

**** Setting up your Development Environment

{{{heading(Software Requirements)}}}

1. Text editor of your choice: Any text editor that you are already familiar
   with can be used for editing the project files.  I will be using Visual
   Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the editor of choice in this
   specialization.  You may also consider other editors such as Brackets
   (http://brackets.io/), Sublime Text (http://www.sublimetext.com/), or Atom
   (https://atom.io/).

2. Browser of your choice: You may use your preferred browser.  I will be using
   Chrome as the browser in all the exercises.  All the exercises and
   assignments in this course have been tested using Chrome v. 46.  Please note
   that not all browsers may support all the HTML5 features to the same extent.
   You might encounter problems when using other browsers.  I strongly urge you
   to use the latest Chrome browser for the exercises and assignments in this
   course so that any problems are minimized.

3. Command line shell: Familiarity with the command-line shell will be
   essential for the exercises.  In Windows a cmd window or power shell with
   admin privileges would be needed.  On a Mac or in Linux, a terminal window
   can be used.  Please get familiar with the "sudo" command in OS X and Linux.

4. Files required for the exercises: We will provide additional starter files
   for the exercises wherever needed.  Links to download the files will be
   provided inline in the exercise instructions that follow each exercise
   video.  Please download the files provided there, if any, before beginning
   the exercise.  The links are also available through the Additional Resources
   of the specific lesson.


*Note*: Please remember to retain the folders and all the files that you create
in the exercises.  Further exercises will build upon the files that you create
in the preceding exercises.  DO NOT DELETE the files at the end of the
exercises, unless otherwise instructed.  You may wish to set up your exercise
folder as a Git repository and commit the files to the repository at the end of
each exercise.  Brief instructions on using Git are available later in this
lesson.

In this exercise you will get familiar with some basic Git commands. At the end
of this exercise you will be able to:

- Set up a folder as a Git repository

- Perform basic Git operations on your Git repository


{{{heading(Basic Git Commands)}}}

- At a convenient location on your computer, create a folder named git-test.

- Open this git-test folder in your favorite editor.

- Add a file named index.html to this folder, and add the following HTML code
  to this file:

  #+name:index.html-skeleton
  #+begin_src html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head></head>

        <body>
            <h1>This is a Header</h1>
        </body>
  #+end_src

{{{subheading(Initializing the folder as a Git repository)}}}

- Go to the git-test folder in your cmd window/terminal and type the following
  at the prompt to initialize the folder as a Git repository:
  : git init


{{{subheading(Checking your Git repository status)}}}

- Type the following at the prompt to check your Git repository's status:
  : git status


{{{subheading(Adding files to the staging area)}}}

- To add files to the staging area of your Git repository, type:
  : git add .


{{{subheading(Commiting to the Git repository)}}}

- To commit the current staging area to your Git repository, type:
  : git commit -m "first commit"


{{{subheading(Checking the log of Git commits)}}}

- To check the log of the commits to your Git repository, type
  : git log --oneline


{{{heading(Modifications)}}}

- Now, modify the ~index.html~ file as follows:

#+name:index.html-modification1
#+begin_src html
  !DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
      <head></head>

      <body>
          <h1>This is a Header</h1>
          <p>This is a paragraph</p>
      </body>
  </html>
#+end_src

- Add a sub-folder named templates to your git-test folder, and then add a file
  named temp.html to the templates folder. Then set the contents of this file
  to be the same as the index.html file above.

- Then check the status and add all the files to the staging area.

- Then do the second commit to your repository

- Now, modify the index.html file as follows:

#+name:index.html-modification2
#+begin_src html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
      <head></head>

      <body>
          <h1>This is a Header</h1>
          <p>This is a paragraph</p>
          <p>This is a second paragraph</p>
      </body>
  </html>
#+end_src

- Now add the modified ~index.html~ file to the staging area and then do a third
  commit.


{{{subheading(Checking out a file from an earlier commit)}}}

- To check out the index.html from the second commit, find the number of the
  second commit using the git log, and then type the following at the prompt:
  : git checkout <second commit's number> index.html

{{{subheading(Resetting the Git repository)}}}

- To discard the effect of the previous operation and restore index.html to its
  state at the end of the third commit, type:
  : git reset HEAD index.html

- Then type the following at the prompt:
  : git checkout -- index.html

- You can also use ~git reset~ to reset the staging area to the last commit
  without disturbing the working directory.
